# Peek - A Lightweight Linux Debugger (WIP)

Peek is a lightweight Linux debugger for 64-bit systems, built from scratch in C++. This project is currently a work in progress and aims to provide essential debugging features with a minimalistic approach. It uses Linenoise for command line editing and Libelfin for parsing ELF and DWARF debugging information.

## Features (Implemented)

- Attaching to processes
- Setting breakpoints
- Inspecting registers
- Inspecting memory-mapped spaces
- Memory manipulation
- Single-stepping instructions
- Source-Level stepping
- Source-level breakpoints
- Symbol resolution
- Stack unwinding
- Backtrace


## Technologies Used:

    Language: C++
    Platform: Linux-x86-64 (WSL2 compatible)
    Build System: g++ / CMake

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

#### Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/msashank910/Peek.git
    cd Peek

#### Build the project:

    mkdir -p build && cmake -B build . && cmake --build build

## ðŸ–¥ Usage

#### To run the debugger:
    
    ./build/pld <file_path_to_debuggee_program>

#### Note: Debugee Program must be compiled with the following flags:

    -g -gdwarf04 --fno-omit-frame-pointer -O0

- You may opt to exclude disable optimizations (-O0), but some functionality may have unexpected behavior

While in the [__p|d__] command-line interface, you can interact with the child process via breakpoints, memory manipulation, and register manipulation.

#### For a full list of commands, use the help command (currently a WIP):

    help

#### Certain commands can be executed via their prefixes or by shorthand abbreviations as well. For example:

    To set a breakpoint - "breakpoint", "break", or "b"
    To read from a register - "register_read" <register_name> or "rr" <register_name>

## ðŸ“‹ Current Limitations

    No GUI (command-line only).
    Limited command support (in progress).
    Binaries must be compiled in C or C++ on x86-64 Linux

## ðŸ›¤ Roadmap

#### Handling Variables

- Inspect and modify local variables and function parameters during execution.

#### Multithreading

- Be able to run multiple concurrent debugger instances with control over all of them.
